In the good old days of the rod of birch a Philadelphia school teacher was very partial to one of his boys, and very severe to another. One day they were both tardy. Rod in hand he called them both up on the floor. “James, my boy,” said he to the favorite regretfully, but kindly, “why were you late to-day?” “You see, sir,” replied James, “I was asleep, sir, and I dreamed I was going to California, and I was down on the wharf, and I thought the school-bell was the bell of the steamboat.” “That will do, my boy,” said the teacher, glad of an excuse to shield his favorite, “always tell the truth, my boy. And now, sir,” said he to the other sternly, “and where were you?” “You, see, sir,” said the other candidly, “I was down on the wharf waitin’ to see Jim off!”
