The Echo

A tourist was told by a guide that the echo on a Killarney lake was very fine. So, off went the tourist to hear it, and hired two men to row him out, accomplishing the transaction so swiftly that there was no time for them to arrange for the usual echo to be in attendance. The echo wasn’t working. What was to be done? In despair of a better expedient, the men that were rowing broke an oar, and one swam ashore to fetch another—and while he was gone, the echo began to work!

“Good morning,” cried the tourist.

“Good marning,” said the echo, with a charming brogue.

“Fine day, sir.”

“Foine day, sir,” improved the echo.

“Will you take a drink?” cried the tourist.

“Begorra, an’ that I will!” roared the echo.
